# EXP-2
EXPT NO: 2 OCC AND LOAD CHARACTERISTICS OF D.C SHUNT GENERATOR

Aim:
To conduct load test on separately excited generators and to obtain the characteristics

Apparatus Required:
laptop with connection

theory

DE generator converts mechanical erergy
into electrical energy.
DC generator works on the principle
of faradays law. It states that "when a conductor cuts the magnetic flur and e.w.f is induced."
The field winding and armature windings are copnected in parallel in the
Open circuit characteristics
It is also known as Magnetisation characteristics or no load characteristics, It is a
graph drawn between open circuit vottage (Eo)and field curent (IF).
Load aircuit characteristics
It is a graph drawn between load vottoge(VL) and load curent (1.). It is also
Known as external characteristics.
Procedure


Open circuit choracteristics:
2.
1· Connections are made as per the circuitdiagram.
Switch on the supply and note dows
the readings (voltage and cursent)
3. By varying the field rheostat differentvalues of oper circuit voltage and fieldcurrent are noted.
4. Plot the graph between open circuit
voltage and field cussent.
Load characteristics:
1. Connections are made as per the
crcuit diagram.
2. Switch on the supply and note the
no load vottage and current.
3. By connecting different nodes, differentvalues of load voltage and note cursentare noted.
4. plot the graph between load voltage and load current
